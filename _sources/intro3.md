# Welcome

This book collects some notes that I took when preparing a short course on AI for engineers.  

:::{note}
The notes are designed for a quick introduction to AI.  The reader is assumed to know a little bit about programming. Appendix 1 reviews the necessary concepts.

I hope you will enjoy the notes.
